# Africa’s Utility Payment Crisis

**1. Cash Dependency**  
- 89% of utility payments are cash-based (IMF 2023), leading to:  
  - **Fraud**: $2.1B lost annually in cash handling (AfDB 2024).  
  - **Delays**: 3-hour average wait times at payment centers (Ghana ECG 2023).  

**2. Currency Instability**  
- **Nigeria**: Naira lost 40% value in 2023 (CBN).  
- **Ghana**: Cedi depreciated 54% against USD (2020–2024).  

**3. Crypto Exclusion**  
- 72% of African crypto users cannot pay bills directly (Stellar 2024 Survey).  
- Existing platforms like *BitPesa* focus on FX, not utilities.  

**4. Diaspora Pain**  
- A Nigerian in the UK pays **$12 fees** to send $200 via Western Union (World Bank).  
- 3-day settlement delays risk service disconnections.
