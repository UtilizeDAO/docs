# Utilize: Bridging Crypto and Essential Services in Africa

**Utilize** is a decentralized platform enabling Africans to pay utility bills (electricity, water, internet) directly with cryptocurrencies. Designed for Africa’s 1.4 billion people, it addresses the continent’s $86B utility payment market (AfDB, 2023) by merging crypto liquidity with essential services.

**Why Africa?**  
- **Crypto Adoption**: Africa leads global peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto transactions, with $117B processed in 2021–2023 (Chainalysis 2023).  
- **Utility Access**: 600M Africans lack reliable electricity (IEA 2024), while 43% of urban households face water shortages (WHO 2023).  
- **Cost Savings**: Remittance fees to Africa average 8% ($12B/year lost), with utilities often paid via costly middlemen (World Bank 2024).
